## Contributions
This project is open to community contributions. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Contributions in the form of new features, improvements to existing features, bug fixes, or documentation enhancements are all welcome!

## Known Issues
- The weather feature is currently not working. This is a work-in-progress project, and I'm actively working on fixing this issue. Contributions to resolve this issue are highly appreciated!
- A lot of questions you prompt to the bot will respond with "none" because there isn't enough data built into the chatbot currently for it to properly respond to the user.
